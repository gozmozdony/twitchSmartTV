# Smart TV Twitch.TV application

A Smart TV appliaction to watch your favourite strams for webOs and Tizen OS.
I'm not using the TwitchJs to embedd videos, because of the hardware limitations of webOs TV-s. Therefore you can't see the chat and all the other functions that twitch provides.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your WebOs TV/Emulator. This version of the app is only for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* LG Developer account
* LG Developer App from the WebOs App Store
* LG Remote App from IOS App Store or Android Google play

```

You can test the application in any browser, by opening the index.html from the dist directory.

## webOS TV Deployment

checkout the webos branch of the repository.
In the WebOs SDK open import the dist build directory as a webOs Project.

To deploy it on a WebOs TV follow these steps to create the required connection to your TV:
http://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/app-test/

After the connection is successful, you can simply click on the build app in WebOs IDE or use the method from here:

Connect the remote app on your smartphone, or use your TV remote, to navigate and start the application.

In the tizen SDK import the dist build directory as a Tizen Project.

To deploy it on a Tizen TV follow these steps to create the required connection to your TV.

## Contribution

Anyone who have ideas how to make it better, feel free to make an issue, or contribute to the code.

## Built With

* [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) - The web framework used
* [Vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) - Routing and history handling
* [Vue-lazy-loading](https://github.com/hilongjw/vue-lazyload) - Lazy loading images
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - The language written in
* [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com) - Semantic UI framework
* [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) - CSS animations
* [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io) - Grabbing streamlinks from twitch


## Semantic additional info

In the dist directory there is an already builded version of the semantic ui what contains only the essential modules for the UI.

## Animate additional info

Only parts used from Animate CSS, therefore all the used animations moved into the style.css in the dist/assets directory.

## Streamlink additional info

The application currently using a self hosted server that uses streamlink. It do not stores any information about the requests. 
The server that responds with the HLS stream sources, uses a token for authentication, what is provided within the webpack config.

## Versioning

I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/gozmozdony/twitchSmartTV/tags).
